ANLY 550: Algorithms and Data Structures for Data Science

Each has something to do with either implementing a data structure from scratch or working with specific algorithms for things like graph traversal, dynamic programming, and NP-hardness.

Assignment 1 contains implmentations of algorithms - from scratch - like matrix multiplication and mergesort.

Assignment 3 contains analytical (and some coding) solutions to various, more advanced algorithms problems.

Programming Assignment 1 and randmst.py explore runtimes for various implementations of minimum spanning trees, based on the number of nodes and dimensions in the graphs.

Programming Assignment 2, strassens.py, 550-2.1.py, and 550-2.2.py discuss the runtimes for various implementations of matrix multiplications; emphasis is on comparing runtimes with respect to memory usage and optimization of operations.
